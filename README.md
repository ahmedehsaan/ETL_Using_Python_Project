# ETL_Using_Python_Project
This project involves converting a JSON file containing anonymous data gathered by URL shortening service Bit.ly in partnership with the US government website USA.gov, into a CSV file. The JSON file contains data on links that end with .gov or .mil. The script takes the path to the JSON file as input and optionally converts the timestamps in the file to Unix format. The output is a CSV file containing the following columns: web browser, operating system, from URL, to URL, city, longitude, latitude, time zone, time in, and time out. The script extracts relevant information from the JSON file, cleans and formats it, and then saves it as a CSV file. The script also outputs the number of rows in the CSV file, the file path, and the execution time of the script.
